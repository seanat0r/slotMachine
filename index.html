                <h2>How does it Work?</h2>
                <p>Click the button to start the spin. Each spin costs a minimum of 1 coin, and you can bet up to a maximum of 20 coins. 
                    The more coins you bet, the more coins you can win. If you hit 0 coins, you lose. You can reset the game at any time 
                    using the refresh button below the spin button. <br>
                    During your game, you can earn free spins. To use them, click on "FREE SPIN". <br>
                    <span class="importantText">>Beware that refreshing the browser or any activity that restarts the browser tab will delete your 
                        current session, and you will need to start again!</span> <br>
                    Good Luck!</p>

                <h2>Special Events</h2>
                <h3>Pitty</h3>
                <p>The pity system depends on your bet, which determines which pity system starts tracking. It's important to know that as soon as you 
                    activate another pity system, the current one will be reset and will need to be built from scratch. <br>
                    - The first pity system tracks your losing streak when you bet 10 coins or less. A losing streak of 5 activates this pity system. 
                    You will lose the pity bonus as soon as you win or bet more than 10 coins in the next round.<br>
                    - The second pity system works similarly but only tracks when you bet more than 10 coins. It activates with a losing streak of 3.</p>
                <h3>Win Streak</h3>
                <p>If you win more than 3 games in a row, every win after that will double the number of coins you earn.</p>
                <h3>Score Event</h3>
                <p>At random scores, you can trigger different score events. These events depend on how many games youâ€™ve played, your total score, 
                       and a bit of luck. <br>
                       Possible rewards include the "Jackpot," which gives you a minimum of 100 coins!</p>
                <h3>Same Symbol Event</h3>
                <p>If you get three of the same symbols, you might earn a special reward.</p>
